# Getting Started with Create React App Template Bulky.

> **_NOTE:_**  Currently this is a beta version and the final version is planned to relesed by April-23 end.


### This is a template for large scale projects including proper flow which is required for large scale projects, the features it will provide will be protected routes, API hooks, notification toast, Propper [routing](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) with examples, Css & Component library pre installed, [state management](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), infinite loading, lazy loading, page not found for unknown routes, error handling for routes, Theme change etc. all the major functionalities required for a web application

##### It gives you a fully developed application for a quick start with major functionalities which are required for your project and takes too much time to setup, So you can forget about setting up the boiler plate you create for different small functionalities all over again for each app you create each time.
##### Creating a bulky React template can be a great way to jumpstart your development process without caring about setting up the functionalities to get started with your project all you need to do is just copy and paste the functionalities or replace the current ui with yours.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). and By [Ishuha](https://github.com/ishuha/cra-template-bulky).
